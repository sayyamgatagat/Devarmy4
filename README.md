stage 0

Develop an webpage, which shows an image with width and height of 500px. Can be any image, as long as it can load in a webpage.
Bonus: Add a header and footer for the webpage

## stage 1

Now to the existing webpage, add a click counter. Every time I click on the image, the counter should increase.
And this is something that I would like to see it myself, I want you to use Github pages to host the application.

Bonus: Add a way to retain the counter after reloading the webpage as well.


## Stage 2

add a new image with it's own clicker count. 
Let's work on making our webpage more user friendly as well.
Add title and a caption below the pictures. Use semantic tags to make the HTML code more easier to read.
Also give unique id to the elements. 

Bonus: Make the webpage responsive. The design choice is yours on how you want to make them look like. Use your creativity.
