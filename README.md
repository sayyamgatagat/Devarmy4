stage 0

Develop an webpage, which shows an image with width and height of 500px. Can be any image, as long as it can load in a webpage.
Bonus: Add a header and footer for the webpage

stage 1

Now to the existing webpage, add a click counter. Every time I click on the image, the counter should increase.
And this is something that I would like to see it myself, I want you to use Github pages to host the application.

Bonus: Add a way to retain the counter after reloading the webpage as well.
